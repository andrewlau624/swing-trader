# Jump & ride hunt log (prompt_jump_hunt.md), session llm-trader-51

## STATE (update after every idea)
- program N: 761 (J1 registered and judged DEAD). k (ideas judged): 1. Ideas explored (runner explore run): 6
  (H17, D5, D9, D4, D6; D6 -> J1). Rounds of idea generation: 1 (62 ideas).
- current idea: none; waiting for the news archive's 2016-23 months for the news ideas.
- next 5 ideas: H1/V1/H3 (Reddit, as subs finish), H5/H6/H16 (Wikipedia, as pageviews finish), H11 option alerts,
  S2 PDUFA run-up, D8 first insider buy + no news (news needed).
- data sources verified: Alpaca/Benzinga news REST (downloading, ~3 months/10 min), Arctic Shift (downloading),
  Wikipedia pageviews (downloading, slow), EDGAR (FTS, form.idx 2016-26, companyfacts), ClinicalTrials.gov v2, openFDA,
  USAspending, Form 345 2014-2026 (data/research/jump/insider_buys_2014_2026.parquet).
- data sources broken: defense.gov (403); Wayback snapshot fetch (refused at 3 threads; retry at 1 per 4 s pending).
- why things die (running): TWO-WAY (attention raises the jump AND crash rate; H17, D4) and LOTTERY (D5, D9, J1:
  three trades carry the mean) so far; next ideas must carry a direction AND many independent events.

## Log
- 12:45 setup: the prompt names `swing-trader`; the session started in the `llm-trader` checkout (no data caches); work in
  `~/Documents/Code/Projects/swing-trader` (same GitHub repo, 13 GB of caches). Fetched 079aa21; tests 356 passed. N 760 (EV2).
  Peers told (llm-trader-9b, 198-eb). Memory note: a prior session ran `jump_runner explore` on FDA approvals (fdaapp)
  while building the runner (all fail); that was a runner smoke test, not part of this hunt, and counts toward nothing here.
- 12:50 probes, one request each: Alpaca news REST 427/975/1357 items on 3 sample days; Arctic Shift posts OK (100/page);
  Wikimedia pageviews OK; openFDA OK; USAspending OK; EDGAR submissions + XBRL frames OK. Started background downloads
  (`research/sim/jump_data.py`): news 2016-01..2026-09 (3 threads), Reddit subs in sequence, Wikipedia pageviews (6 threads).
- 13:05 reachability: defense.gov 403 (D3 falls back to news headlines); ClinicalTrials.gov v2 OK; Wayback CDX OK
  (Yahoo trending-tickers: 2,275 daily snapshots 2016-24, ~350/yr 2017-20); Arctic Shift subreddit metadata OK.
  Added idea **H24** (first appearance of a small cap on Yahoo's trending-tickers page, Wayback snapshot) before any
  outcome.
- 13:10 **H17** trade-count spike, quiet price: built (`jump_h17.py`, 9,571 events, 3,685 in select); explore running.
- 13:15 **D5** hot-word renames (`jump_d5.py`; EDGAR form.idx names at filing time, so delisted renamers are kept):
  131 renames, 91 with a ticker, 43 in select -> 10 trades. Explore (1 look), all 12 cells fail:
  `hold60 n 10 jump 20.0% vs base 10.7% (x1.9) mean net +44.3% ex-top3 -12.3% median -1.9% vs usual +51.2% P 0.10`
  (one +274%); `tp205 n 10 jump 10.0% vs 8.9% mean -4.2%`; `hold20 mean -11.0% median -11.7%`. **DEAD: TOO RARE +
  LOTTERY** (most hot renamers trade OTC or under $1; 2 tradable a year).
- 13:40 runner speed: `jump_runner._rets` (numpy) replaces the per-row Python loop in `trades()`; `_ret` stays the
  reference and `test_vectorized_returns_match_reference` checks all 12 cells on random bars; D5 explore re-run
  prints identical lines. H17 explore: 47 s instead of > 20 min. No gate, cost or window changed.
- 13:42 **H17** explore (1 look; the slow run was killed before printing): 3,685 events -> 2,233 trades (558/yr).
  `hold1 jump 1.4% vs base 0.5% (x3.1) mean net -1.0% median -1.2%`; `hold5 jump 6.4% vs 3.1% (x2.1) mean -1.2%`;
  `tp2020 jump 34.0% vs 25.2% (x1.4) mean -0.2% median -0.2% P 0.69`; `trail60 mean -1.2% vs usual +1.4%`;
  `hold60 mean -7.4%`. All 12 cells fail both tracks. **DEAD: new death TWO-WAY** — attention without a price move
  raises the jump rate 2-3x at 1-5 days, but it raises the drop rate too (worst −43% at 1 day): attention predicts
  size, not direction; the small-cap cost then makes the mean negative.
- 13:55 **D9** first Phase 3 posted on ClinicalTrials.gov by a small listed sponsor (`jump_d9.py`, 12,534 industry
  Phase 3 studies, exact sponsor-name match): 227 events, 150 select -> 111 trades. Explore (1 look), all fail:
  `hold5 jump 9.0% vs base 3.5% (x2.6) mean net +1.4% ex-top3 -0.6% median -0.8% P 0.18`; `trail60 mean +1.7% vs
  usual +3.9% ex-top3 -3.4% median -8.4%`; `hold1 x5.2 mean -0.6%`. **DEAD: LOTTERY** (the registry is a slow venue,
  and the 5-day lift is real, but 3 trades carry the mean).
- 14:20 **D4** first 8-K naming a hot theme (`jump_d4.py`; 14 themes, FTS 8-K by quarter 2014-26, 730-day "first",
  ADV$ < $20M): 2,690 events, 1,191 select -> 752 trades. Explore (1 look), all fail:
  `hold1 jump 0.8% vs 0.3% (x2.6) mean -0.9%`; `tp201 x3.5 mean -0.8%`; `hold20 mean +0.3% ex-top3 -1.3% median
  -1.3% vs usual +1.6% P 0.44` (one +646%); `trail60 mean -1.9%`. **DEAD: TWO-WAY + LOTTERY** (a theme word in an 8-K
  is not news the market pays for).
- 14:25 Wayback refused connections (archive.org rate limit) with 3 fetch threads for H24; stopped, deleted 55 failed
  (empty) snapshot files, fetcher now one request every ~4 s and skips failures. Retry later; a second failure drops H24.
- 14:30 `jump_news.py` written (h7 h8 h9 h10 h11 h12 h14 h21 h22 s1 s1v s2 s2v s3 s4 s5 w2 w5), smoke-tested on
  2016-01..2018-01 news (no outcomes). Pre-registered S variants (one allowed per idea, written before any run):
  S1/S3 primary = buy at the announcement if the date is >= 7 sessions later; S1v = fd 6 sessions before the date
  (hold5 ends the session before). S2 primary = fd 21 sessions before the PDUFA date (hold20 ends the session before);
  S2v = 6 sessions (hold5). Benzinga 2016-17 carries few PR-wire stories (S1: 20 conference stories in 2 years).
- 14:55 **D6** first profitable quarter (`jump_d6.py`): 726 events, 473 select -> 299 trades. Explore (1 look):
  `hold60 n 299 mean net +7.3% ex-top3 +4.5% median -0.6% vs usual +7.2% P 0.00 | ride MEETS`; `tp2060 mean +2.9%
  median +18.5%`; `hold20 mean +2.3% P 0.03`; `hold1 x3.4 mean -0.8%`. Diagnostics on select only (no rule change):
  ticker mapping 63% (2016) .. 92% (2025) = survivorship risk; year means +21/+14/-1/-8/+42/-5/-5/+14%.
- 15:00 Registered **Study J1** (RIDE hold60, N 760 -> 761, b555a07); peers told (llm-trader-ee; llm-trader-9b gone).
- 15:02 **J1 judge** (once): `hold60 n 48 (24/yr) jump 33.3% vs base 21.7% (x1.5) mean net +5.5% ex-top3 -1.8% median
  +3.3% vs stock's usual +3.7% hit 52% worst -81% best +142% P(mean<=0) 0.21` -> **RIDE VERDICT: DEAD**. k = 1.
  Write-up `study_jump_d6_first_profit.md`. LOTTERY (3 trades carry the mean) on too few trades.
