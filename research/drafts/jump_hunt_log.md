## Log
- 12:45 setup: the prompt names `swing-trader`; the session started in the `llm-trader` checkout (no data caches); work in
  `~/Documents/Code/Projects/swing-trader` (same GitHub repo, 13 GB of caches). Fetched 079aa21; tests 356 passed. N 760 (EV2).
  Peers told (llm-trader-9b, 198-eb). Memory note: a prior session ran `jump_runner explore` on FDA approvals (fdaapp)
  while building the runner (all fail); that was a runner smoke test, not part of this hunt, and counts toward nothing here.
- 12:50 probes, one request each: Alpaca news REST 427/975/1357 items on 3 sample days; Arctic Shift posts OK (100/page);
  Wikimedia pageviews OK; openFDA OK; USAspending OK; EDGAR submissions + XBRL frames OK. Started background downloads
  (`research/sim/jump_data.py`): news 2016-01..2026-09 (3 threads), Reddit subs in sequence, Wikipedia pageviews (6 threads).
- 13:05 reachability: defense.gov 403 (D3 falls back to news headlines); ClinicalTrials.gov v2 OK; Wayback CDX OK
  (Yahoo trending-tickers: 2,275 daily snapshots 2016-24, ~350/yr 2017-20); Arctic Shift subreddit metadata OK.
  Added idea **H24** (first appearance of a small cap on Yahoo's trending-tickers page, Wayback snapshot) before any
  outcome.
- 13:10 **H17** trade-count spike, quiet price: built (`jump_h17.py`, 9,571 events, 3,685 in select); explore running.
- 13:15 **D5** hot-word renames (`jump_d5.py`; EDGAR form.idx names at filing time, so delisted renamers are kept):
  131 renames, 91 with a ticker, 43 in select -> 10 trades. Explore (1 look), all 12 cells fail:
  `hold60 n 10 jump 20.0% vs base 10.7% (x1.9) mean net +44.3% ex-top3 -12.3% median -1.9% vs usual +51.2% P 0.10`
  (one +274%); `tp205 n 10 jump 10.0% vs 8.9% mean -4.2%`; `hold20 mean -11.0% median -11.7%`. **DEAD: TOO RARE +
  LOTTERY** (most hot renamers trade OTC or under $1; 2 tradable a year).
- 13:40 runner speed: `jump_runner._rets` (numpy) replaces the per-row Python loop in `trades()`; `_ret` stays the
  reference and `test_vectorized_returns_match_reference` checks all 12 cells on random bars; D5 explore re-run
  prints identical lines. H17 explore: 47 s instead of > 20 min. No gate, cost or window changed.
- 13:42 **H17** explore (1 look; the slow run was killed before printing): 3,685 events -> 2,233 trades (558/yr).
  `hold1 jump 1.4% vs base 0.5% (x3.1) mean net -1.0% median -1.2%`; `hold5 jump 6.4% vs 3.1% (x2.1) mean -1.2%`;
  `tp2020 jump 34.0% vs 25.2% (x1.4) mean -0.2% median -0.2% P 0.69`; `trail60 mean -1.2% vs usual +1.4%`;
  `hold60 mean -7.4%`. All 12 cells fail both tracks. **DEAD: new death TWO-WAY** — attention without a price move
  raises the jump rate 2-3x at 1-5 days, but it raises the drop rate too (worst −43% at 1 day): attention predicts
  size, not direction; the small-cap cost then makes the mean negative.
