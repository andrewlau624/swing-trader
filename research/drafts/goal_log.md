# Goal hunt log (`prompt_strategy_goal.md`, session llm-trader-ec)

## STATE (update every iteration)
- round 1 · ideas written 10 (G1-G10) · k (judged) 2 · program N 772 (next free 773)
- NEAR: G2 (forward follow-up G2-F); G1 bound NEAR at $10k (+8.8pp after tax judge), FOUND-level at $2.3k (+20.5pp) but
  conditional on Schwab rounding B1 (VIVK ~10-07; check state/roundup-orders.json in llm-trader after 10-07).
- track streak: T1, T5 -> next T2 or T3
- NEXT: T2 G4 ADR terminations: count from documents (EDGAR full text "termination of the deposit agreement" /
  Form F-6 POS / 25-NSE on ADRs) 2016-26, events/yr and the contractual payoff from terms only (no prices yet).

## Notes carried in from other hunts (read 2026-10-02)
- Index-beat (llm-trader-ee): HAIRCUT: at edge-halves the live bot ~= SPY in both accounts; the only thing that beat the
  index at edge-halves was beta under the bot (R6-5 stacked on a SPY core, near miss). So any Goal book should be an
  overlay on an index core, not a replacement of it. No N registered there.
- EV2-big's >= $500k cut saw 2024-26; it can't be judged on 2024-26. Insider data here starts 2020-01 (events 2022+),
  so 2016-21 is untouched for every insider rule: that is the only honest holdout left for T1.
- llm-trader-3e's N = 593 message is stale (pre-Round 17); program N is 768 per llm-trader-51 / -ee.

## Log
- 2026-10-02 16:30 setup: read NEXT.md (dead list), prompt_hidden_edges.md, prompt_index_beat.md death map, EV2 study,
  index_beat_log STATE. Messaged all 6 peer sessions. Round 1: G1-G10 written before any outcome (T1 x2, T2 x3, T3 x3,
  T4 x1, T5 x1). Round quota so far: T1 2/8, T2 3/8, T3 3/8, T4 1/8, T5 1/4.
- 2026-10-02 16:45 G2 pre-registered (e6316e8, N 768 -> 772: G2a, G2b, two report rows). Correction to the
  registration text: "2016-20 has never been looked at for any insider rule" is not quite right: the Jump hunt's J2
  (insider buy after a 30% fall, +20% within 5 sessions) used 2016-23 insider buys on its select half. Different rule
  (conditioned on a crash, 5-day jump target), different exit; the EV2-big open->close rule was never computed on 2016-21.
  Using llm-trader-51's 2014-19 Form 345 zips (data/research/jump/insider/, read-only); my own duplicate downloads in
  night/insider were deleted so `outside_box.insider_buys()` (which globs that folder) can't change.
- 2026-10-02 17:00 **G2 judged: NEAR** (study_goal_g2.md). Holdout 2016-20, 195 trades: +68.7bp/trade (tier_hi +55.4),
  every year > 0, NW t 3.48, ex-best-5%-days +0.33 / ex-best-5-trades +0.46 (lottery test passes), null 100th pct, G2a
  after tax vs SPY +11.3pp ($2.3k and $10k, no deposits; +12.5 / +12.2 with $1k/mo), tier_hi +9.0-9.1pp, maxDD 31%,
  worst month −9.5% (2020-03), worst trade SPG −5.9% of equity; G2b (1.0x) +16.5..+21pp, maxDD 33-34%. Missed bar: a
  clean judge half (2024-26 saw the cut; untouched 2021 was −10bp/trade, t 0.09). DSR 0.553. Reported rows: EV2 all
  sizes ~0 (+7.9bp), ID3 >= $500k without silence +35.7bp x 1,788 trades, 2021 +23.8bp: the SIZE cut carries it.
  Follow-up G2-F registered (forward ev2_big gate, no new N). First judge run crashed on a dsr() dict print after the
  per-trade lines; rerun = same code, print fixed. Checked a suspicious 2021 IRR (+10.5pp on a ~0 overlay): deposit
  timing (all wins in Q4 on a larger account), not a bug; time-weighted numbers lead the write-up.
- 2026-10-02 17:15 **G1 bound (no N): NEAR at $10k.** From the registered deal tables: judge 2024-26 taxable deal $
  $725 at $2.3k (+20.5pp after tax) / $1,356 at $10k (+8.8pp); holdout +17pp / +13pp; Roth +4.4pp (B1 only). B1 rounding
  at Schwab unverified; without B1, $2.3k is ~+10pp. Nothing to build (all parts live). study_goal_g1.md.
