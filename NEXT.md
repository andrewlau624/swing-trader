# Pending decisions

Short, current, and the first thing to read when picking this up again.
Full evidence lives in `RESULTS.md`; this file is just what is *waiting*.

---

## 0. Uncap the candidate list — READY, YOUR CALL

**Status:** found 2026-09-22, validated (RESULTS.md addendum 5), **not enabled.**

`selection.top_n: 8 -> 999` plus `portfolio.position_pct: 0.10`:
Sharpe 0.95 -> 1.16, CAGR 15.1% -> 22.3%, maxDD -14.4% -> -15.3%,
risk-matched 15.1% -> ~21%. The rank score has no predictive power (ranks 9+
earn the same as 1-8), shuffle/flip controls pass, beats baseline every year.

**Why now is cheap:** the systemd unit failed with 216/GROUP on every run until
924d854, so the live slippage sample is ~empty. Switching before fills
accumulate costs the experiment nothing.

**Open question before trusting live numbers:** live re-selects daily; the
backtest re-selects every 42 days, and an honest 21-day refresh scored far
worse (9.5%). Build a short-refresh backtest that matches the executor.

## 1. Switch on the overnight-gap filter — WAITING ON LIVE FILLS

**Status:** researched, validated, committed, **deliberately not enabled.**

**What it is:** require that a dip be made mostly of overnight gaps
(`prev_close -> open`) rather than intraday selling, over a 5-day window.
Implemented as `strategy.min_overnight_share` in `config.yaml`, currently
`null`.

**What it buys** (walk-forward, 2021-2026, high-vol cohort, −10% stop, cash in BIL):

| | now (off) | with filter 0.3 |
|---|---|---|
| Sharpe | 0.95 | **1.34** |
| max drawdown | −14.4% | **−11.1%** |
| avg per trade | +2.46% | **+5.00%** |
| risk-matched CAGR | 15.1% | **22.3%** |
| months to significance | 40.5 | **19.5** |
| trades | 207 | 111 |

**Why it is off:** the live run exists to measure real slippage against the
20bps/side the backtest assumes. Changing the strategy mid-experiment
contaminates that measurement, and the underlying feature was only nominally
significant (Spearman +0.158, p=0.020, failing Bonferroni across 9 features).

**Trigger to turn it on:** roughly **20 real fills** collected, i.e. measured
slippage has converged (`make slippage` shows n ≥ 20).

**Then:**
```bash
make slippage                      # record the before number
$EDITOR config.yaml                # strategy.min_overnight_share: 0.3
make dry                           # sanity check
git commit -am "enable overnight filter after N fills"
```
Keep the before/after clean — that comparison is the whole point of waiting.

**If measured slippage comes back far worse than 20bps** (say >50bps/side),
turn the filter on *sooner*: its per-trade edge is +5.00% vs +2.46%, so it
tolerates roughly twice the cost before the edge disappears.

## 2. Lingering on the server — CHECK THIS

`make persist-status` must say `lingering: ON`. If it says OFF, the systemd
timer dies the moment the SSH session closes and the bot silently never runs.
As root: `loginctl enable-linger ihearthim`.

---

## 3. Email — never actually verified

`make notify-test` has not been run successfully. Until it has, assume alerts
do not work. `trading@andrewlau.dev` is a verified domain so it should be fine,
but "should" is not "did".

## Things already tested — do NOT redo these

| idea | verdict | why |
|---|---|---|
| News sentiment filter | **dead** | mean P&L diff +0.97pp, p=0.63 |
| FF3 residual z-score | **dead here** | FF3 explains only 22% of variance in this universe; strips little, adds 4 params of noise |
| Bertram optimal thresholds | **dead** | prescribes −0.4σ entry; risk-matched return falls monotonically as entry loosens. −2.0 was already optimal |
| Trailing / let-winners-run exits | **dead** | selection screens for *non*-trending names; a trend-following exit contradicts it |
| Long/short (shorting range tops) | **dead** | negative in every configuration |
| Looser entry for more trades | **dead** | raises CAGR, raises drawdown faster |
| Broad-market cohort | **weak** | 1.6% CAGR vs 15.1% — the edge needs high volatility |
| Momentum sleeve at 25% | **promising, unvalidated** | blend Sharpe 1.09 vs 0.95, but standalone CAGR swings 1.2–43.6% across settings |
| Parking idle cash in BIL/SGOV | **ADOPTED** | 86% of position-days were idle; +3.3pp CAGR, free |
| Uncapped candidates (top_n 999) | **found, pending** | risk-matched 15.1 -> 21.0%, controls pass (addendum 5) |
| z_window 10 / 40, formation 63 / 252 | **dead** | all 4-9% risk-matched vs 15.1% |
| −10% stop vs no stop | **ADOPTED** | 11.8% vs 8.6% CAGR, and lower drawdown |

## Ideas not yet tested

- Backtest with the executor's daily re-selection (see item 0)

- Multiple formation horizons (5/10/20d) simultaneously — the one remaining
  structural fix for 14% capital utilisation
- Cross-sectional ranking instead of a binary z-threshold (always deployed)
- Crypto sleeve (24/7, AVAX/DOT/LTC screen as tradable)
- Limit orders at the bid instead of market-on-open — this strategy *supplies*
  liquidity, so it may earn the spread rather than pay it

## 4. Daily-cadence book — NEW, see RESULTS.md addendum 6

Three near-uncorrelated legs. Combo 38% CAGR / Sharpe 1.58 / −18% DD,
positive every year 2021–26, trades daily. Suggested paper order, most
robust first:
1. IBS tech ETFs at next open (simplest, no intraday infra needed)
2. QQQ noise-area intraday (needs a 30-minute intraday loop)
3. Overnight loser bounce (15:50 scan → MOC, MOO exit): regime-dependent,
   paper-trade it the longest before trusting it
Each needs its own executor. None of this touches the current swing config.
